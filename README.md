# Cartwheels
* Visualize python dependencies
* Remove transitive dependencies
* Find compatibility sets

## tl;dr;

Install requirements via `setup.py`

```bash
pip install .
```

Run Jupyter lab
```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open [chart_my_wheels](http://localhost:8888/lab/tree/chart_my_wheels.c-matrix.ipynb)
* Link works if you use the default port:`8888`

Change the `dependencies` list to your project requirements

![img.png](img.png)

Run all ![img_1.png](img_1.png)

The output of the last cell visualizes your dependencies, for example:

![img_2.png](img_2.png)

As a bonus it also:
* Lists other compatibility (or version) sets

### More info

Explanations of optimizations and methods are inlined both in notebook and classes 

## Troubleshooting

We cache the package, please change the above call and pass the argument 'True' to invalidate cache and refresh pull from [pypi](https://pypi.org). **NOTE:** This could take hours! 

```python
PkgGraph(dependencies, session, trailing).resolve(True)
``` 

The default configuration is to pull the last `5` versions of packages that can be linked from the `dependencies` list. If you need more comprehensive history, change this number accordingly.
